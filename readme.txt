Notice :
1. If you have problem running or debugging the project, bulid again after clean build.
2. If the code is regenerated by CubeMX, you must follow the Attention of readme(WaveShare).txt

This commit :

- Add SpareAread read & write operations (functions)

1. For use of SpareArea, add SpareAread read & write operations (functions) to Nand_BSP

=========================================================

Previous commit :

- Use the latest version firmware to test Nand Flash
1. Migrated the project to work with the latest version of the firmware.
2. Modified .ioc file to reflect that the struct related to NAND Device itself has been changed slightly.   
   ( CubeMX -> Connectivity -> FSMC -> NAND1 -> NAND characteristic info )
   ( + The struct is located in "stm32f1xx_hal_nand.h". )   
3. Because of 2. , modified Nand_BSP and main.c

- Use obsolete version firmware to test Nand Flash
1. Nand BSP added
2. Include path setting added for BSP
3. main.c modified for Nand Flash test
4. uart.c modified for printf
5. stm32f4xx_hal_nand.h modifed along Attention of readme(WaveShare).txt 

- Create Nand Flash STM32 Project from .ioc file
